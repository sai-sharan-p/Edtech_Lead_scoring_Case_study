# Edtech_Lead_scoring_Case_study

This repository consists of a case study on an ed-tech company. They are trying to maximise their efforts on lead conversion where they want to spend more energy & resources on higly potential leads instaed giving focus to all leads. 

In order to help the company we have used their previous year data and implemented a machine learning model to calculate the scores of the leads. Suppofe if the lead has a higher score, that means that they are more like to purchase a course from them. 

This repository has the following items which helped us building this model and the business understanding of it. 
 - Data (CSV file).
 - Data dictionary.
 - Analysis & modelling file (Python)
 - Summary of the analysis.
 - Presentation of the analysis. 
 - Business sense of entire case study. (in the form of Q&A)
